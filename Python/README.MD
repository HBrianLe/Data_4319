# Python Projects
___

This folder contains Machine Learning Projects using Python. In this, we make various models using both a combination of scratch code machine learning and machine learning packages such as Scikit, Keras and, Tensorflow. Below list the projects that are made in this folder. Each one of these projects are of supervised  or unsupervised learning.
