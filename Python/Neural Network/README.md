## Neural Network

In this folder, we work on the MNIST dataset for a Neural Network project. [Previously](https://github.com/HBrianLe/Data_4319/blob/master/Julia/Neural%20Network/Artifical%20Neural%20Network%20.ipynb), we made a neural network model from scratch in Julia. In this project, we work in Python and use Tensorflow to build a model that we can use on the MNIST dataset.
