## Decision trees

In this folder, we focus on two machine learning classification types of Decision Trees and Random Forest. Both these topics go hand and hand and we can combine both these topics into one notebook. We use Scikit learn for doing both these topics. In this project, we use the Wine Dataset to classify wines included in the dataset.
