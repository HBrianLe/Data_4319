## K-Nearest Neighbors 

Here, we demonstrated the K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm in ways in python. First is the use of scikit learn packages to produce a model. The second is using scratch python code to model the k-nearest neighbor model. Both models produce similar results but using preset packages are much more efficient and faster than scratch.
