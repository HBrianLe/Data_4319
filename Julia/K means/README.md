##  K Means

This is a project of K means with random artificial data that is created by Julia formulas. Our goal is to classify the created data to their class or categories.   

<ul>
<li>Concepts using in this algorithm </li>
<ul>
<li>Selecting and creating batches of data</li>
<li>Visualize the data that is created </li>
<li>Creation of centeroids for the mean of the data. </li>
<li>Understanding the distance or Euclidean formulas for all points</li>
<li>Apply and correctly classifying the point selected to the right class with updating the means of the data.</li>
<li>Find the correct amount of clusters to be classified. </li>
</ul>
