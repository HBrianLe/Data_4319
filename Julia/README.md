# Julia Projects
___

This folder contains Machine Learning Projects using Julia. In this, we make various models using scratch code. All these project are use without any packages for the attempt of learning theory and coding of the fundamental machine learning algorithms. Below list the projects that are made in this folder. Each one of these projects are of Supervised  or Unsupervised learning.
