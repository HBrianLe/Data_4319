## Neural Network

This is a project is the use of an artificial neural network from scratch. We use the main concept of multilayered perceptron to build this model and used backpropagation to trace back our errors to adjust the weights. We applied this network on to the MNIST dataset of computer vision numbers for this project. 

<ul>
<li>Concepts using in this algorithm </li>
<ul>
<li>Initialize random weights for the start of the model. </li>
<li>Use of Sigmoid function as our activation function for errors. </li>
<li>Use of Batch gradient descent for training and selecting our step and epoch values in our model. </li>
<li>Demonstrate the math behind gradient descent and backpropagation for our model.</li>
<li>Produce accurate results of number classifications. </li>
